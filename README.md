# How it works
Article Wiki requests wikipedia articles page links and their relations and construct color groups based on <b>wikibase</b> data of the relative subjects using (<b>Instance of</b>) or (<b>Subclass of</b>) properties. additionally nodes are weighted by their <b>pageviews</b> stats on wikipedia.
Article Wiki uses <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django framework</a> and <a href="https://visjs.org/">vis.js framework</a> for visualizations.
